Welcome to my github profile.  I'm a VMware TAM that's recently been trying to get more into the automation space.  The reason is I feel that we can do so much more
if we just try to think outside of the box.  For years I was the one that was fine with "point and click" type of installs and setups.  But now I want to make my IT life easier.

So my interests are Horizon EUC, as you will see in a few of the scripts I've put together either by borrowing code from others or trial and error on my part.
